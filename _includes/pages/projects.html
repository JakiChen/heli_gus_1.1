                    Objective<br>
                    The idea of placing virtual objects in the real world has been around for sometime but the technology has never really been good enough. With the launch of Apple’s newly relased ARKit we we’re asked to conceptualize, art direct and design the AR app of IKEA.

                    <br><br>
                    Concept<br>
                    Allowing the many people to virtually place furniture in the own homes will help them unleash their imagination of home furnishing. While at the same time enabling IKEA to “open” millions of new showrooms globally trough people’s smartphones. The power of the smartphone and argumented reality brings IKEA closer to the people and people closer to IKEA.</div>
                <div data-name="bot">
                    Design<br>
                    Our approach of the design has been to create an interface that feels as natural and intuitive as possible. IKEA is after all for the many. Aesthetically we’ve focused on bringing the IKEA brand to life trough small details while making sure the core experience is so simple, almost invisible —allowing people to focus on unleashing their imagination.

                    </br></br>
                    When designing the app our focus has been to design a natural and familiar interface using traditional UI elements and conversational interaces in context of the camera.
                    </br></br>
                    In this way people will know what to expect and feel confident when placing their first virtual object in real-life.</div>

                    Concept<br>
                    Our strategy was to bulid a design system that was based on the idea of spaces. Spaces meaning a free area of expanse which consists of width (X), height (Y) and depth (Z). Spaces are in a sense another word for using modules but spaces allows for a more felixible system. This strategy left us with the challenge to explore and define what digital spaces are, how they relate, connect, animate and behave.

                    Result<br>
                    The design direction is inspired by swiss graphic design from the 1960’s where the focus was to create a strong system of typography, colors and compositions. Given that there is a vast amount of content the approach of the style is to define an editorial and timeless aesthetics with room for details using both layout, functionality and animation.

                    Concept<br>
                    The brandname mitte® means "middle" in german. It's a reflection of finding balance. It's also the name of the area where the brand resides.</div>
                <div data-name="bot">
                    Design<br>
                    The design direction is defined as an approachable, natural and new classic brand tapping into a simple and functional aesthetic that caters to the lifestyle of young global citizens.</div>

                <div data-name="top">Brandmark & signature<br>
                    The brandmark serves as the icnoic element of the mitte® identity. It's a simple graphic translation of the brandname which is created by placing a solid circle in the middle of a rounded sqaure. The idea of the mark is adopted from the negative space that appers between the "i" and the "t" of the brandsiganature.

                    Concept<br>
                    The concept of the visual identity is build around the idea of a canvas. A canvas being a frame to facilitate content. The canvas resembles the purpose of the company which is to facilitate visual sharing.

                    Design<br>
                    Focusing on the concept of the canvas we wanted to create a design system that provided TwentyThree™ with simple tools. We developed a design system inspired by common wayfinding principles. These principles acts as guideance troughout the visual language of typography, colors, iconograpy and grid systems.</div>
